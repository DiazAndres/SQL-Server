--H. Finding rows of multiple JOINS
SELECT
	 [soh].[SalesOrderNumber]
	,[soh].[OrderDate]
	,[soh].[TerritoryID]
	,[st].[Name]
	,[st].[CountryRegionCode]
	,[cr].[Name]
	,[soh].[ShipMethodID]
	,[sm].[Name]
	,[sm].[ShipRate]
	,[soh].[TotalDue]
FROM
	[Sales].[SalesOrderHeader] AS [soh]
	INNER JOIN [Sales].[SalesTerritory] AS [st]
		ON [st].[TerritoryID] = [soh].[TerritoryID]
	INNER JOIN [Person].[CountryRegion] AS [cr]
		ON [st].CountryRegionCode = [cr].[CountryRegionCode]
	INNER JOIN [Purchasing].[ShipMethod] AS [sm]
		ON [soh].[ShipMethodID] = [sm].[ShipMethodID]
WHERE
	(
		    [sm].[ShipRate] >= 1.49

		AND [soh].[TotalDue] BETWEEN 1000 AND 5000
		AND [soh].[OrderDate] >= '2014-01-01'
	)
	OR
	(
		    [st].[CountryRegionCode] = 'US'
		AND [soh].[TerritoryID] NOT IN (4,3)
	)
ORDER BY
	[st].[CountryRegionCode] ASC


--I. Filtering rows by using condition to update rows
SELECT 
	 ListPrice + (ListPrice *.010)	AS 'New Price'
	,ListPrice						AS 'Old Price'
FROM
	[Production].[Product]
WHERE
	[ProductNumber] LIKE 'BK-%'

UPDATE [Production].[Product]
SET ListPrice = ListPrice + (ListPrice *.010)

--J. Filtering rows by using condition to delete rows
SELECT 
	*

DELETE FROM
